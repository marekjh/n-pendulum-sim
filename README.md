# n-pendulum-sim

Run with ```python run.py```
Simply push the space bar to let the simulation run, and press it again to pause the simulation. Press the "T" key to turn on and off a trace following
the motion of the outer pendulum over time, and press the "R" key to reset the trace. Pause and click/drag the masses around to reset the initial conditions
to whatever you want! Planning to add a graphical interface so that system parameters like pendulum lengths and mass amounts can be easily adjusted.
